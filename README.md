# Machine-Learning-RecommendationSystem

Different Recommendation systems are applied to a movie dataset from kaggle. The datasets can be found at

In the first branch, content based recommender is designed. A GUI via Tkinter is also designed which asks the user about their top three movies and then recommends them a list of 20 movies they might like. For simplicity, only genres are concidered for modelling. The advantage of this model is its simplicity.
